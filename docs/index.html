Through the visualizations of the COVID data, we will analyze the importance and impact of COVID in different regions around the world. Within the past two years, the daily routine is changed by the COVID 19 worldwide. The pandemic has spread around the world at a very fast and unstoppable rate leading to severe illness threats to people of different races and ages. Economy, market, education, hospitalization, work have all been heavily affected. As a result, countless people’s lifestyles were changed dramatically. We began to do all the things remotely, we work from home, we study from home and we shop from home. This is definitely a situation that has never happened throughout history which makes it more attractive and essential for us to further explore this topic.</p><div class="OverviewParagraph"><h2 id="covid-new-confirmed-cases">COVID New Confirmed Cases</h2><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/NewConfirmedCases/Sheet1?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="832"></iframe></div><div class="OverviewParagraph">
To make the new cases comparable for the continents at the same scale, the top graph shows the percentage of new confirmed cases in terms of their population. All continents South America seems like having the cases under control since the rate of new cases regards its population is converging to a low number. </div><div class="OverviewParagraph">
The bottom graph shows the actual cases in number for all continents. The more the cases means there would be a higher chance that the region has a mutated virus. Based on the graph, we would guess that the next mutated virus might be more likely to emerge in South America or Asia. </div><h2 id="immuned-population">Immuned Population</h2><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/ProtectedPopulationPercentage/Sheet3?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="832"></iframe><div class="overview_partb">
Herd immunity happens when a large portion of a community (the herd) is immune to a disease which makes the spread of disease unlikely. The <span class="annotated-text">herd immunity threshold<span class="annotation-text">If the proportion of the population that is immune to the disease is greater than this threshold, the spread of the disease will decline.</span></span> for COVID-19 is at 60–70%, and the population will gain immunity either through vaccinations or past exposure to the virus. The herd immunity threshold would increase if the mutation of the COVID becomes more contagious.</div><div class="overview_partb">
From the Immuned Population Percentage graph, North America has the highest percentage in the immuned population which is the sum of the total past infection and fully vaccination groups at approximately 32%, but this is still less than the herd immunity threshold. Also, vaccination is the most efficient way to reach the threshold than the infection by the trend of increasing in the immuned population. </div><div class="OverviewParagraph"><h2 id="covid-new-and-total-death-cases">COVID New and Total Death Cases</h2><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/DeathCasesOvertime/Sheet2?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="832"></iframe></div><div>
Similarly, to compare all continents at the same scale, both graphs are displaying the percentage in terms of the population of the continent. The top graph displays two groups with similar percentages of total deaths which are also the same two groups of continents from the total cases in the percentage of the population graph. It is intriguing that whether the number of death is correlated with the number of cases. We will further explore the correlation between the factors in the later section. </div><div class="overview_partc">

For the number of new cases graph on the bottom, we also see the same pattern in the number of new cases in the percentage of the population which all continents except South America are decreasing and converging to a low number.</div><div class="overview_conclude"><p>
Thus, in short, it seems like all continents are having the COVID situation under cntroled except South America. </p><p>We will examine the impact of COVID-19 in the follwing sections.</p></div></div><div id="Effect" class="fullWidth content parta parta_top"><h1 id="impact-of-pandemic">Impact of pandemic</h1><h2 id="why-should-we-care-about-covid-and-its-prevention-effect-of-the-covid?">Why should we care about COVID and its prevention Effect of the COVID?</h2><p>COVID-19 has been a worldwide pandemic, people took it as an emergency when it happened in Winter 2020. Each person infected with seasonal influenza may infect approximately 1.3 other people. SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) is estimated to infect about three times as many people (estimated at 2 to 4). This number is called the reproductive factor, or “R0,” and you may see it referred to that way. This will lead to many, many more cases very quickly, and may overwhelm an already burdened medical system.
 It’s true that for healthy people under age 50, it’s not especially lethal — the mortality rate is quite low, but still up to 20 times higher than flu. But it becomes more lethal for older patients. The following chart gives good estimates for mortality rate by age bracket compared to flu. The WHO estimates an average mortality rate of 3.4%, which is around 100 times higher than flu, but does note that average is across age brackets. And while you may not die, you may give it to others, which will overwhelm our healthcare system.)</p><h2 id="compare-sars-with-covid-19">Compare SARS with Covid-<!-- -->1<!-- -->9</h2><p>This is a visualization of SARS’s total cases distribution in 2003 around the world. While it’s also a pandemic that originated from China similar to Covid-19, and they are both fatal respiratory illnesses caused by a coronavirus. We believe observing them, in contrast, can lead us to pay more attention to details of Covid-19 we didn’t notice before. From this map, we can easily find that China has way more cases than any other country, although this is also a worldwide pandemic, the number of total cases is much less than Covid-19 and China has occupied more than 90 percent of the total cases. Moreover, SARS has a recording death rate of approximately 9.04% which is very high, but fortunately, this pandemic does not last for a long time, it’s greatly affected by the temperature that it faded away after moving into summer.</p></div><div class="fullWidth twomaps"><div class="flex-container"><div class="flex-item"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/shared/C4HZ9XZZC?:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe></div><div class="flex-item"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Cse412Homework2covidmapnew/Sheet35?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe></div></div></div><div class="fullWidth content parta  parta_bottom"><h2 id="trend-of-cases-of-covid-19-around-the-world">Trend of Cases of Covid <!-- -->1<!-- -->9 <!-- -->around the world</h2><p>On the other hand, we take a closer look at what’s happening during 2020 Covid-19 in this visualization. We focused mainly on China, the UK, and the US since more pandemic-related issues are happening down there. we can see except at the beginning of this pandemic eruption, China has been taking incredibly good control of cases in comparison to the USA, and the UK. And we observed that although there is an obvious decrement in cases during summer, unlike SARS which faded away after that, the Covid-19 came back again in a more unstoppable way that leads to a higher peak of new cases. And it started to drop down at the time when the vaccine started to come out. Also by comparing the upper graph and lower graph(users can do this by dragging the mouse to select multiple points in the upper graph, and the corresponding points would appear in the bottom graph), the number of deaths is almost moving in the same way as the number of new cases, which means Covid-19 has a relatively constant death rate.<div class="parta_fix"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Cse412Homework2trendnew/Sheet33?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="1000"></iframe></div></p><h2 id="death-of-elder-group">Death of elder group</h2><p>Now we also wonder how does age contributes to the possibility of getting contagious during this pandemic. Again we picked China, UK, and the USA to study. We have two bar graphs, the upper one showed the confirmed cases of different age groups, and three countries have very similar compositions that are most confirmed cases are from median age group, while the least of cases are from age of 70 or older. The bottom bar graph showed the number of deaths of different age groups. Surprisingly, most of the deaths are composed of people who are 85 years older, and people older than 75 years old have taken around 50 percent of the total deaths while the number of deaths is decreasing rapidly to even zero as the age group getting younger and younger. We conclude that although the median age group has a much higher number of confirmed cases, the number of deaths of older people is much higher which indicates Covid 19 is indeed more lethal to older people.</p></div><div class="fullWidth twobars"><div class="flex-container"><div class="flex-item"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Cse412Homework2bar1new/Sheet23?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe></div><div class="flex-item"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Cse412Homework2bar2new/Sheet22?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe></div></div></div><div class="fullWidth content parta parta_end">
Next seesion will explore some potential correlated factors that might explain the difference in the COVID-19 outcomes around the world.</div><div id="Correlation" class="fullWidth content partc"><h1 id="possible-correlated-factors-with-covid-19">Possible Correlated Factors with COVID-<!-- -->1<!-- -->9</h1><p>From the graphs above, we can see that there is a clear distinction between the number of confirmed cases and death cases for different regions. 
Take Gross Domestic Product(GDP) per capita, Population density, Human Development Index (HDI), life expectancy, and the number of people who 
are aged 65 or older as possible social factors that might affect the outcome of COVID-19 cases, we will specifically focus on these dimensions 
in our exploration.</p><p>Try to select the desired dimension from the drop-down menu to encode the color. 
You can also filter the expected line by brushing the interval on each dimension axis!</p><div class="partcgraph"><iframe width="100%" height="831" frameBorder="0" src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@patronum/brushable-parallel-coordinates?cells=viewof+keyz%2Clegend%2Cviewof+selection"></iframe></div><p>
Data source reference to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases">COVID-19 dataset</a> from Our world in data in our visualization. Data was normalized. 
The visualization design above reference to Parallel Coordinates Visualization by Mike Bostock in Observable notebook. </p><h2 id="gdp">GDP</h2><p>Within one standard deviation of average GDP across 174 countries in our cleaned dataset, GDP and the number of total cases and the number of total deaths shows a positive correlation. Beyond one standard deviation, in general, as GDP increases the number of total cases increases as well as the number of total deaths.</p><h2 id="population-density">Population density</h2><p>Population density is positively correlated with the total cases and the total deaths for each location one standard deviation below mean population density.
The total cases and total deaths show a decreasing trend as the population density beyond the mean increases.</p><h2 id="hdi">HDI</h2><p>In general, HDI is positively correlated with the number of total cases and the number of total deaths.</p><h2 id="the-number-of-people-who-are-aged-65-or-older">The number of people who are aged <!-- -->6<!-- -->5 <!-- -->or older</h2><p>Generally, as the number of people who are aged 65 or older increases, the number of total cases increases. It is interesting to note that locations that 
have the number of people who are aged 65 or older 1.5 standard deviations above the mean with the number of death below the mean have GDP above the mean.</p><h2 id="vaccinations">Vaccinations</h2><p>Observing the location that has total vaccinations 0.5 standard deviations above the mean, we notice that most of the locations have GDP, HDI, and life expectancy above the mean. Some of those locations might have a relatively high number of total cases, but most of them have a relatively low number of total deaths.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>From the visualization, we did not observe a clear pattern between each dimension and the COVID outcome. 
This implies that these factors alone do not have a significant impact on COVID-19 cases. 
The disparities in COVID cases might be a synergistic effect of multiple social factors. Further research is needed.</p><p>However, it is commonly believed that vaccination is the most effective preventive measure of COVID-19. We will explore more indepth about vaccination efficacy and vaccination rate in the next section.</p></div><div id="Vaccination" class="fullWidth content partd lightgraybg"><h1 id="vaccination-data-analysis">Vaccination Data Analysis</h1><h2 id="type-of-vaccination">Type of Vaccination</h2><p>mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine to protect against infectious diseases. mRNA vaccines <em>teach</em> <em>our</em> <em>cells</em> <em>how</em> <em>to</em> <em>make a</em> <em>protein</em> that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. </p><p>Inactivated vaccines use the <em>killed</em> <em>version</em> <em>of</em> <em>the</em> <em>germ</em> that causes a disease.
