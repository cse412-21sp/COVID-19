The bottom graph shows the actual cases in number for all continents. The more the cases means there would be a higher chance that the region have a mutated virus. Based on the graph, we would guess that the next mutated virus might be more likely to emerge in South America or Asia. </div><h2 id="immuned-population">Immuned Population</h2><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/ProtectedPopulationPercentage/Sheet3?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="832"></iframe><div class="overview_partb">
Herd immunity happens when a large portion of a community (the herd) is immuned to a disease which makes the spread of disease unlikely. The <span class="annotated-text">herd immunity threshold<span class="annotation-text">If the proportion of the population that is immune to the disease is greater than this threshold, the spread of the disease will decline.</span></span> for COVID-19 is at 60–70%, and the population will gain immunity either through vaccinations or past exposure to the virus. The herd immunity threshold would increase if the mutation of the COVID becomes more contagious. </div><br/><div class="overview_partb">
From the Protected Population Percentage graph, North America has the highest percentage in the immuned population which is the sum of the total past infection and fully vaccination groups at approximately 32%, but this is still less than the herd immunity threshold.

Similarly, to compare all continents at the same scale, both graph are displying the percentage in terms of the population of the continent. The top graph displays two group with similar percentage of total deaths which are also the same two groups of continents from the total cases in percentage of the population graph. It is intriguing that whether the number of death is correlated with the number of cases. We will further explore the correlation between the factors in the later section. </div><br/><div class="overview_partc">

For the numbe of new cases graph on the bottom, we also see the same pattern in the number of new cases in percentage of the population which all continets except South America are decreasing and converging to a low number.</div><div class="overview_conclude">
Thus, in short, it seems like all continents are having the COVID situation under cntroled except South America. </div></div><div id="Effect" class="fullWidth content parta"><h1 id="why-should-we-care-about-covid-and-its-prevention-effect-of-the-covid?">Why should we care about COVID and its prevention Effect of the COVID?</h1><p>COVID-19 has been a worldwide pandemic, people took it as an emergency when it happened in Winter 2020. Each person infected with seasonal influenza may infect approximately 1.3 other people. For SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19), it is estimated to infect about three times as many people (estimated at 2 to 4). This number is called the reproductive factor, or “R0,” and you may see it referred to that way. This will lead to many, many more cases very quickly, and may overwhelm an already burdened medical system.
  It’s true that for healthy people under age 50, it’s not especially lethal — the mortality rate is quite low, but still up to 20 times higher than flu. But it becomes more lethal for older patients. The following chart gives good estimates for mortality rate by age bracket compared to flu. The WHO estimates an average mortality rate of 3.4%, which is around 100 times higher than flu, but does note that average is across age brackets. And while you may not die, you may give it to others, which will overwhelm our healthcare system. <img src="./static/images/parta/pic1.png" alt="pic1"/></p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Cse412Homework2map/Dashboard13?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="1000"></iframe><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Cse412Homework2trend/Dashboard6?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="1000"></iframe><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Cse412Homework2age/Dashboard12?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="1000"></iframe><h2 id="death-of-elder-group">Death of elder group</h2><p>Table: display the number of deaths caused by Covid 19 in each age group

We can draw a pie graph and a bar chart with composition of different age groups to display what we’ve observed from the above table. 
We can add small titles of China, USA and UK to separately display the pie chart of them.<img src="./static/images/parta/pic3.png" alt="pic3"/>
After we found the result we may observe that older people are much more vulnerable to the pandemic than younger, so we wonder if the seriousness of this pandemic is related to the occupancy of old people in a country.<img src="./static/images/parta/pic4.png" alt="pic4"/><img src="./static/images/parta/pic5.png" alt="pic5"/>

Take Gross Domestic Product(GDP) per capita, Population density, Human Development Index (HDI), life expectancy, and the number of people who 
are aged 65 or older as possible social factors that might affect the outcome of COVID-19 cases, we will specifically focus on these dimensions 
in our exploration.</p><p>Try to select the desired dimension from the drop down menu to encode the color.

- mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine to protect against infectious diseases.
- MRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response inside our bodies.
- The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines, is those vaccinated gain protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19.</p><p>Inactivated
- Inactivated vaccines use the killed version of the germ that causes a disease.
- Inactivated vaccines usually don’t provide immunity (protection) that’s as strong as live vaccines. So people may need several doses over time (booster shots) in order to get ongoing immunity against diseases.</p><h2 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h2><p>mRNA
Data from 43,448 participants, half of whom received BNT162b2 and half of whom received placebo, 
showed that the vaccine candidate was well tolerated and demonstrated 95% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 in those without prior infection 7 days or more after the second dose.</p><p>Inactivated
Based on 144 participants in the phase one trial and 600 in the phase two trial - meant the vaccine was “suitable for emergency use”.</p><h2 id="side-effect">Side effect</h2><img src="./static/images/SE_chart.png" alt="side_effect"/><h2 id="state-cases-&amp;-vaccination-rate">State Cases &amp; Vaccination Rate</h2><p>Visualization Design: A map of United States.</p><p>Interaction with color dots shows the total doses given, the number of people fully vaccinated, and the percentage of people fully vaccinated by state.<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Book4_16225226793100/Sheet1?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="900"></iframe></p><p>In the United States, the total vaccinations doses given is 294M, the population who are fully vaccinated is 135M, and the percentage of population fully vaccinated is 41%. </p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Book5_16225363428390/Sheet2?:language=zh-CN&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="260"></iframe><p>Among all the states, Republic of Palau has the highest percentage (68.9%) of population who are fully vaccinated due to the small population base.
